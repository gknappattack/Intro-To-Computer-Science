# Intro-To-Computer-Science
Coursework and projects for BYU CS 142 Intro to Computer Science (now known as CS 111).


## Course Outcomes: 

-Write programs whose complexity reaches a few hundred lines

- Use the rudiments of the environment and the resources available to help them program (editors, basic computer architecture, compilers, libraries, reference manuals, on-line help).

- Develop programs from an English description.

- Write programs on their own, independent of "hand holding" by a TA or an instructor (typically a dozen or so).

- Understand and use the basic programming constructs: types (built in types, basic provided types including arrays and strings, type construction), values (constants,variables, assignment statements, and expressions), control structures (sequential flow, conditional statements, and loops), and I/O (basic output to the screen and input from the keyboard, and file I/O).

- Understand and use objects (value representation, applicable operations, hidden implementations).

- Implement basic recursive algorithms.

- Describe and use the basic ideas of some of the more advanced programming constructs,including exceptions, inheritance, and polymorphism.

Understand the importance of the following concepts:

- Abstraction

- Debugging and Assurance of Correctness

- Program Development (analysis, specification, design, implementation, testing)
